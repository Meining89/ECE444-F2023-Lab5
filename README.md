## TDD Pros and Cons
**Pros**: TDD will improve code quality. It asks developers to think about the problem and edge cases before implementing codes. So that the code will be accurate and comprehensive. It also helps to avoid common coding mistakes and ensures that the code fulfills its intended purpose. This will also allow developers to figure out and fix bugs and errors at an early stage. Furthermore, because TDD is usually in unit test format, it will also encourage developers to write code that is small, concise and focuses on one functionality which lead to a good software design.

**Cons**: It is complex to write tests, especially for complex functionalities. Writing tests requires a deep understanding of the problem and edge cases. Developers must spend a lot of time understanding the problem and environment before writing actual codes to solve the problem. Furthermore, as more codes are added, the tests must evolve with it. Developers need to  update tests to reflect changes in the code's functionality. This will make the codebase larger and larger with the development of projects which might be a disadvantage for resource-limited projects.
