## TDD Pros and Cons
Pros: TDD will improve code quality. It encourages developers to think about the problem edge cases before implementing codes. So that the code will be accurate and comprehensive. It also helps to avoid common coding mistakes and ensures that the code fulfills its intended purpose. 

Cons: It is complex to write tests, especially for complex functionalities. Writing tests requires a deep understanding of the problem and edge cases. Developers must spend a lot of time understanding the problem and environment before writing actual codes to solve the problem. Furthermore, as more codes are added, the tests must evolve with it. Developers need to  update tests to reflect changes in the code's functionality.
